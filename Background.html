    <p> My name is<strong> Immanuel Barboi</strong>, a web developer and currently studying in Daystar University doing Computer Science.
      I was raised in Nairobi, Donholm area to be specific. My brother introduced me to programming and here I am creating websites and making changes to them.
      I started doing simple basics of programming in youtube while I was still a kid and that is where I developed my passion in programming.</p>
